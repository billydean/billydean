### Currently Working On
- [ ] Tightening up my JS syntax through CodeSignal
- [ ] Meeting stretch goals set out for me in BloomTech's coursework
- [ ] A smarter, more modular, more "realistic" random character generator

### I've worn many hats:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;philosopher,[^1] translator,[^2] writer, game designer,[^3] and full stack web developer.
[^1]: Feel free to poke around my dissertation on the concept of design, [*Repurpose in Deleuze and Design*](https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1794/24834/Goehring_oregon_0171A_12417.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y). Feedback welcome, but know that all dissertations are written under duress, so be kind ðŸ˜….
[^2]: See my contributions to [The Deleuze Seminars](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/index.php/), a large-scale project out of Purdue University, funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities.
[^3]: Writing, Testing, and Co-Designing an upcoming card game with spooky slug person, [Miranda Zimmerman](https://www.faunwood.com/).
